      In order to start using mayajs you must install the latest stable version of
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" class="link">Nodejs</a> on your local machine. Having a prior knowledge in
      <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" class="link">Typescript</a> or
      <a href="https://angular.io/" class="link">Angular</a> will help you alot. Like angular, mayajs uses typescript
      and much of the syntax implemented are heavily inspired from it.
